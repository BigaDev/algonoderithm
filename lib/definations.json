{"haversin": {"explanation": "The haversine formula is an equation important in navigation, giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes. It is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles.", "input":"the first paramter geo location {latitude:'', longitude:''}, the second paramter array of json object each object should contain longitude and latitude [{latitude:'',longitude:''}, {latitude:'',longitude:''}]", "output": "the haversin fucntion will add distance for each object in the list(second paramter) and return it"}}
